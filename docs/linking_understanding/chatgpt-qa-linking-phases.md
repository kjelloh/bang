# C++ Linking Phases - Q&A with ChatGPT

## Question

It seems on Linux a C++ app is 'linked' in two stages? The first when the app is built by the compiler? And the second when the system is linked with the environment to run it?  
Do I understand this correctly? And can you add any additional information on this matter?

## Answer

You're very close to the right idea, and it's great that you're trying to understand the C++ linking process on Linux. Let's break it down clearly and add some nuance.

### Two Key Linking Phases in Linux

---

### 1. Static Linking (at Build Time)

This is the **first linking stage**, handled by the **compiler and linker** (`g++`, `ld`, etc.).

When you compile your C++ code:

    g++ main.cpp -o myapp

The compiler:
- Translates `main.cpp` to machine code (`main.o`).
- The **linker** then:
  - Combines object files and libraries into a final **executable binary** (`myapp`).

#### Two types of linking during this stage:
- Static linking: Copies all required library code into the final executable.
- Dynamic linking: Includes references to external `.so` files (shared libraries) that are resolved at runtime.

> If shared libraries are used, the executable is not fully standalone â€” runtime linking is still required.

---

### 2. Dynamic Linking (at Runtime)

This is the second linking stage, handled by the runtime linker/loader, typically:

    /lib/ld-linux.so.* or /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2

When you run the executable:

    ./myapp

The runtime loader:
- Loads the binary into memory.
- Finds and loads all required shared libraries (`.so` files).
- Resolves symbols (function calls, variables, etc.).
- Transfers control to your `main()` function.

If a library is missing, you may see:

    error while loading shared libraries: libfoo.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

---

### Useful Commands

    ldd ./myapp
        Lists shared libraries used by your executable

    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/custom/path ./myapp
        Helps runtime linker locate `.so` files

    g++ main.cpp -static -o myapp
        Builds a fully static binary (no runtime linking)

    LD_DEBUG=all ./myapp
        Debugs runtime linking issues (very verbose)

### Summary Table

Phase: Static/Dynamic Linking at Build Time  
Tool(s): g++, ld  
When: Compile time  
What: Produces the executable and links in libraries

Phase: Dynamic Linking at Runtime  
Tool(s): ld-linux.so.*  
When: Runtime  
What: Loads shared libraries and resolves symbols
